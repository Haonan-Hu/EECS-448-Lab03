      Kratos is the protagonist of the God of War series.
      Born in Sparta, Kratos was a respected soldier and General,
      up until he lost his wife and daughter when he killed them,
      albeit by accident, under Ares' command, earning him the nickname
      of "The Ghost of Sparta", after which he renounced his service to
      the war god, eventually killing him and ascending to Godhood before
      exacting revenge against his father, the Olympians and the Titans who betrayed him.<br><br>
      After successfully exacting his vengeance, Kratos escaped into the
      world of Norse Gods by settling down in Midgard in Ancient Norway where he
      married another woman named Faye and bore a son named Atreus who together,
      after the boy's mother’s death, would embark on a journey to spread her ashes
      at the highest peak of all the nine realms.<br><br>
